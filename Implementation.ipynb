If we assume that the background grid is defined using a mesh of discrete points (as opposed to some analytical mapping), that means that a spline of some kind is required to create a continuous, differentiable mapping from $\\zeta_3$ to physical space. There are several strategies that can be employed here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Catmul-Rom Cubic Spline: This $C^1$ continuous spline is easy to compute on the fly using finite differences to estimate the nodal derivatives. However, since we are not $C^2$ continuous, jumps in the curvature parameter will occur (which may or may not be a problem). Furthermore, there if there are any kinks in the background grid, undesireable local extrema may occur in the interpolant. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Akima Cubic Spline: A more elaborate $C^1$ spline that is robust to kinks and discontinuities in the grid. Like Catmul-Rom, can still be computed on-the-fly and will exhibit jumps in the curvature. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Classic Cubic Spline: $C^2$ continuous, so guarantees smooth curvature metrics. However, computing the derivatives requires a tridiagonal solve so this method is not amenable to on-the-fly computation. Rather, we would precompute the slopes and store them, doubling the required storage. However, the background mesh can be fairly coarse in the wall normal direction, so this may not be a deal breaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Catmul-Rom Quintic Spline: $C^2$ continuous by construction and easy to compute on the fly. If memory is a concern, this is a nice option, but would be even more prone to local extrema  on non-smooth grids. An interesting option, but would complicate the lookup process.\n",
